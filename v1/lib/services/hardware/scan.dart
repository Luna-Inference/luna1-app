// Goal: Scan & detect luna device on a network

// Flow: Given Luna on the same network as user. First, scan for all device ip address and do an api call as below to detect
/*
Endpoint: /luna
Method: GET
Description: Used for device recognition among all devices on the network. Returns a simple JSON object indicating the device type.
Request Body: None
Response (JSON):
{
    "device": "luna"
